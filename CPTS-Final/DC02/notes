after getting DCSYNC on DC01 - discovered a new forest trilocorai.local
found user svc_datakeeper with RM rights on DC02
user is kerberoastable
got creds
logged in to DC02
on DC02, leveraged Event Log Reader privilege to find some credentials for svc_veracrypt
this user can also RM on DC02
leveraged diskshadow.exe to make a backup of NTDS.dit
also used reg save command to obtain the SAM and SYSTEM hives
copied all of these files over to attack host to extract hashes
used Administrator hash from ntds.dit to PTH Evil-WinRM to obtain root flag
